Area Forecast Discussion...UPDATED
National Weather Service Norman OK
924 AM CDT Thu Oct 10 2019

.UPDATE...
Cold front is quickly moving across the area this morning. Temperatures
rapidly fall after the front passes. The front is moving faster
than previously forecast so made adjustments to account for this.
Some showers/storms continue to develop in parts of southern OK
and north TX this morning. Additional storms are expected to
develop along the front with some of these storms potentially
becoming severe. With the faster movement of the front, made a
slight adjustment SE. Will continue to monitor conditions and make
adjustments for frontal timing as the day progresses.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /issued 629 AM CDT Thu Oct 10 2019/

AVIATION...
A strong cold front has already made it over WWR early this
morning, and will continue to march southward throughout the day.
Expect an initial wind shift from the WNW and then NNW thru
tonight. Gusts to 35 kt will be possible behind the front.
Thunderstorms are expected to develop very close to OKC/OUN but
feel like they`ll move out fairly quickly so have included VCTS
only for the time being. In addition to gusty winds, MVFR cigs
will also briefly be possible behind the front. Skies should begin
to clear later today.

PREV DISCUSSION... /issued 416 AM CDT Thu Oct 10 2019/

DISCUSSION...

A warm and humid night will give way to drastic changes today as a
cold front brings thunderstorms to portions of the area and a much
colder airmass in behind it. Currently the front is moving
quickly southward through the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles, and
is right on the doorstep of our far northwest counties. The front
will continue its fast progress, nearing the I-44 corridor by 18z
and will be close to clearing our area by 00z Friday. Expect
steady or falling temperatures behind the front, with most areas
staying in the 50`s and 60`s across northern and western Oklahoma.
Ahead of the front, warm and humid conditions will help create an
unstable airmass and thunderstorms are expected to quickly fire
along the front by mid afternoon.

Exactly where the front is located during this time period will
determine who sees storms and who doesn`t. Right now, we expect the
majority of the thunderstorm activity to be confined to along and
southeast of the I-44 corridor, which is where we are outlooked for
a slight risk of severe thunderstorms. The main threat with these
storms will be hail and damaging wind gusts, although an isolated
tornado cannot be ruled out with the initial semi-discrete
development. As we head into the evening, additional thunderstorms
may develop behind the front as warm air advection increases atop
the frontal zone. Elevated instability behind the front does not
look overly impressive, so these storms should be mostly sub-
severe with a risk for some small hail.

Temperatures should plummet behind the front as the sun goes down,
and strong cold air advection continues. Near or slightly below
freezing temperatures are possible for portions of northwest
Oklahoma, but held off on upgrading the Freeze Watch at this time
as forecast temperatures are borderline and there is still some
lingering uncertainty regarding degree of mixing as winds will
stay elevated overnight. Continued cold air advection will keep
temperatures cool on Friday, with highs only in the 50`s for most
areas. Winds weaken and skies should be clear by Friday night,
which should create more ideal radiational cooling conditions.
This will allow for temperatures to drop quickly, and another
freeze watch will likely be needed later for a larger portion of
the area Saturday morning.

The deep upper trough begins to lift out by Saturday, which should
allow for a slow warming trend this weekend. Another front should
move into the area on Tuesday, but the airmass behind this one
doesn`t look nearly as cold. At this point the front appears to be
mostly dry, with only a slight chance for rain across southern
Oklahoma.
