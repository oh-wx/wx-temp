.AVIATION...
/12Z TAFs/

Scattered showers and thunderstorms will continue to develop
roughly along the 850 mb front. This activity will move east
across the Metroplex TAF sites until about 14Z with a slightly
later start and end time in Waco. MVFR ceilings will also
accompany this activity along with some temporary visibility
restrictions in light to moderate rain. The precipitation will end
and ceilings will lift above 3000 ft once the elevated boundary
sinks south and large scale lift over the wedge of cool/dense air
decreases. Increasing subsidence on the back side of the departing
upper low will result in clearing skies from north to south this
afternoon.

A strong and gusty north to northwest wind this morning between 16
and 22 knots along with some gusts around 30 knots will gradually
decrease this afternoon with speeds falling below 12 knots early
this evening.

.SHORT TERM... /Issued 418 AM CDT Fri Oct 11 2019/
/Today and Tonight/

A broken line of storms will continue impacting portions of
Central and East Texas early this morning. Although the cells are
below severe limits, gusty winds of 30 to 40 mph will still be
possible with the activity before it exits the CWA by sunrise.
Behind the line, gusty north winds are ushering in the coolest air
of the season. However, this wind shift at the surface will not
spell an end to the rain chances. Some overrunning moisture has
produced some lingering showers, but the bulk of the postfrontal
activity will continue to be focused near the 850mb front. This
steep incline along the frontal slope is responsible for the
renewed development from the Concho Valley and Big Country
northeastward into southern Oklahoma. While this activity is not
expected to become severe, it will result in some rumbles of
thunder and brief heavy rain as the cells spread across North
Texas through the morning commute.

Sustained wind speeds will occasionally flirt with the wind
advisory criterion, but the limited duration should preclude the
need for an advisory. The strongest winds will be confined to the
morning hours during which gusts will frequently exceed 30 mph.
Combined with temperatures in the 40s and 50s, the wind chill will
make yesterday`s heat feel like a distant memory. The incidence of
thunder will steadily diminish through midday, but the elevated
frontal boundary will take much of the day to clear the CWA. In
our Central and East Texas counties, rain will linger well into
the afternoon, and the accompanying cloud cover will keep
temperatures in the 50s. The sun will re-emerge in areas along and
north of the I-20 corridor, and while the north winds will
maintain the cold advection and the corresponding chill in the
air, the mercury may top 60F during the mid to late afternoon.

The postfrontal surface high will settle into North Texas tonight,
diminishing wind speeds. Combined with clear skies and low
humidity, overnight temperatures will plummet. Radiational cooling
will be maximized across our northern and western zones where the
axis of the high will be anchored during the predawn hours. These
areas will see daybreak temperatures in the 30s, encouraging the
development of frost. In the Dallas/Fort Worth heat island and in
our breezier southern zones, temperatures will bottom out in the
40s, precluding frost and the need to protect sensitive
vegetation.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 418 AM CDT Fri Oct 11 2019/
/This Weekend Through Next Week/

After an unseasonably cool start to Saturday, temperatures will
rebound into the 60s. While still the coolest Saturday since May
11, the light winds and low humidity will make for a remarkably
pleasant afternoon (with temperatures about 10 degrees warmer
than Friday afternoon`s). An impulse embedded in zonal flow will
pass overhead Saturday night into Sunday morning, increasing cloud
cover and perhaps resulting in a few sprinkles of rain. The deep
dry layer beneath this lift should limit the precipitation, but
the clouds will keep Saturday night`s temperatures about 10
degrees warmer than the preceding night. In the disturbance`s
wake, sunny skies and even warmer temperatures are expected
Sunday. High temperatures will continue to increase by about 10
degrees each day, returning to the 80s regionwide by Monday.

The subtropical ridge will assume its more seasonal position over
the Gulf of Mexico next week, maintaining mid-latitude westerlies
over the Lone Star State. This flow will begin tapping into a deep
conveyor of tropical moisture from the Pacific, resulting in rain
chances more indicative of the second wettest month of the year.
Tuesday may be the wettest day as this plume of moisture interacts
with our next cold front. This front will not be as strong as its
predecessor, resulting in seasonal daytime temperatures in the 70s
for Wednesday and Thursday.
