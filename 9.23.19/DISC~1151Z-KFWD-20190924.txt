.AVIATION...
/12Z TAFs/

Waco: GOES-16 Night Fog imagery reveals very patchy stratus just
east of the Waco terminal this morning. The potential for brief
MVFR ceilings affecting Waco remains possible through 14Z.
Otherwise, rain-free conditions and VFR will prevail.

Metroplex: The main concern with this TAF issuance is the
potential for scattered convection this afternoon. Models
continue to initiate scattered showers and thunderstorms late this
morning across portions of the Bowie and Bonham cornerposts, but
should not affect the Metroplex. Similar to yesterday, the best
timing for VCTS affecting Metroplex terminals remains after 21Z as
instability increases with daytime heating.

Otherwise, besides gusty outflow winds associated with scattered
convection this afternoon, southerly to southeasterly winds near
10 knots will prevail.

.SHORT TERM... /Issued 341 AM CDT Tue Sep 24 2019/
/Today and Tonight/

Latest radar and satellite imagery reveal a decaying complex of
storms across our northwest this morning. This activity will
slowly continue on a downward trend, but may reach the far
northwestern zones by the morning hours.

While our region remains along the western edge of the upper
level ridge, the main weather story for today and tonight will be
the potential for scattered showers and thunderstorms across North
Texas. The best chances remain across the Red River counties,
where a weak surface boundary and convectively induced mid-level
vorticity will provide an area of focus scattered convection
through most of the day. However, development near and north of
the I-20 corridor remains possible with the aid of daytime heating
and remnant outflow boundaries from Monday afternoon and night`s
convection.

Model soundings across North Texas reveal inverted-V profiles
with CAPE values upwards of 1500-2000 J/kg, 0-6 km shear near 15
knots, and high precipitable water values close to 2". This would
support a threat of gusty winds, lightning, and pockets of heavy
rain with any stronger thunderstorms that do develop. For our
southeastern counties, there are low (15%) PoPs during the late
afternoon hours as a weak upper level trough along the Texas
coast attempts to initiate scattered showers and thunderstorms.

Otherwise, abundant cloud cover will allow afternoon high
temperatures along the Red River to warm into the mid to upper
80s, while partly sunny skies will keep areas across Central
Texas in the mid 90s. Rain-free conditions are expected overnight
for most of the region, with the exception being the far
northeastern counties where low storm chances will remain.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 341 AM CDT Tue Sep 24 2019/
/Wednesday through Monday/

Low rain chances are advertised through the remainder of the
week, mainly across North Texas. These low rain chances spread
southward to encompass the remainder of Central Texas this
weekend. All indications are that early next week appears largely
rain/storm-free. The start of astronomical fall will be a warm
one, with temperatures (both highs and lows) above normal values.

Low rain/storm chances remain in the forecast for locations near
and north of I-20 and east of US HWY 281 on Wednesday and Thursday
morning. A weak shortwave trough is expected to slide eastward out
of the Rocky Mountains into the Central Plains late Tuesday and
into early Wednesday. Low level mass response is expected to
result in a 35-40 knot low level jet which should extend from the
Kansas/Oklahoma border and down into western North Texas and the
Big Country. A loosely organized cluster of storms should develop
across north central Oklahoma and dive toward the Ark-La-Tex. This
feature could clip far northeastern sections of the forecast area
up near the Bonham-Paris-Sulphur Spring areas and I`ve maintained
low PoPs during the morning and early afternoon hours on
Wednesday. Extended reaches of the 06 UTC HRRR and the latest NAM
suggest that a second round of late afternoon convection will be
possible---likely along remnant outflow---and to capture this
potential, I`ll advertise a 15-20 PoP for parts of North Texas.
Outside of occasional lighting strikes and brief heavy rain, not
much in the way of significant impacts are expected. A similar
setup is anticipated on Thursday morning, but chances are a hair
lower and I`ll only advertise showers during this time frame.

It will remain unseasonably hot during the mid-week time frame
across most of the area as modest height rises start to impinge on
mostly Central Texas and parts of North Texas. High temperatures
will be at least 10 degrees above seasonal normals with most
areas likely to climb into the mid to upper 90s. The exception to
this rule may be across areas near and north of the US HWY 380
corridor on Wednesday when afternoon showers/storms during peak
heating may keep highs in the upper 80s to near 90 degrees. With
lower rain/storm chances on Thursday, it`s probable that highs
areawide will be in the 90s...with mid to upper 90s likely
gripping a good part of North and Central Texas.

The upper air pattern will start to shift on Friday as a cut-off
low---currently across the Pacific Southwest---will finally become
enveloped within the main upper level flow and emerge into the
Southern Plains. Mid and low level flow will start to veer some
which could foster some slight adiabatic compression as air
descends from West TX and the Big Country. For now, I`ll keep
highs well above normal with temperatures in the 90s for a good
part of the region, though if European MOS numbers are to verify,
some locations could climb to near the century mark. Fortunately,
a weak shortwave trough may attempt to translate
north/northeastward and spread very modest lift---and possibly
cloud cover---across parts of the Big Country and Central Texas.
Model guidance has backed off considerably with regards to QPF and
I`ve lowered PoPs down to near 15 percent and will advertise
showers on Friday morning. Some weak convection associated with
the weak sea-breeze front may attempt to slide northward later
Friday afternoon, but the overall prospects for measurable rain
look very slim.

Friday night into Saturday offer the next best chances for
rain/storms as stronger forcing for ascent should arrive as the
main upper low ejects out into the Panhandles. Jet entrance
forcing, coupled with strengthening low level flow/WAA should fuel
showers and storms across western North Texas and into the Big
Country. It`s a little hard to say this far out, but based on the
overall synoptic setup, there`s a shot that there will be some
loosely organized convective modes (storm clusters or broken line
segments). Given the range in the forecast, PoPs will be
broad-brushed, with the best rain/storm chances near and
northwest of a Comanche to D/FW to Sherman/Denison line. Low
rain/storm chances will continue into the day on Saturday. The
coverage at this time remains unknown, so for now, I`ll keep PoPs
in line with model blends---around 20 to 30 percent. The cloud
cover on Saturday should at least equate to cooler conditions, but
given the uncertainty in the coverage of precipitation, highs are
still forecast to remain a little above normal. Low rain/storm
chances linger into the day on Sunday, though it`s possible that
some alterations to the PoP and temperature forecasts will be
needed based on how Saturday pans out.

Initial glances at early next week don`t look overly promising
for much of a cool down. In fact, the deterministic ECMWF and GFS
appear to rebuild the ridge a little quicker and further to the
west compared to previous model iterations. This should keep North
and Central Texas above normal through at least Wednesday. There
is a slim glimmer of hope for a cold front next week and the GFS
and ECMWF have more or less been in agreement regarding possible
FROPA. For now, let`s not get our hopes up just yet as this is
very far out.
