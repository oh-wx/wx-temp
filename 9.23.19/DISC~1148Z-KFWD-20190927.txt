.AVIATION...
/12Z TAFS/

The main concern through the period will be the potential for MVFR
cigs this morning and again Saturday morning. Satellite imagery
shows a swath of low clouds spreading north out of Central Texas
this morning. Cigs associated with this batch of clouds have
generally been just above 1000 ft. We`ll have a TEMPO in at Waco
for the next few hours as they are skirting right along I-35. Some
of these may briefly get into DAL through 15Z before the low level
jet veers and takes the bulk of the moisture off to the east.

There will be some scattered showers over southeast TX this
afternoon but most of this activity will remain well removed from
the major airports.

Another round of MVFR cigs is expected Saturday morning and will
likely be more expansive in coverage. We`ll have some MVFR cigs in
at Waco, but these may need to be added to the Metroplex at the
18Z issuance. The upper low over the southwest U.S. will eject
eastward tomorrow and may provide some lift for scattered
afternoon showers and storms. We`ll continue to monitor this
potential through the day.

.SHORT TERM... /Issued 345 AM CDT Fri Sep 27 2019/
/Today and Tonight/

North Texas remains under the influence of mid and upper level
subtropical ridging which will continue to keep things hot and
mostly dry for the foreseeable future. Today will be no
exception, although a disturbance over the southwest U.S. will
have some minor impacts on our weather.

Satellite imagery shows clear skies this morning across North
Texas, although an expanding area of stratus is noted across parts
of Central Texas and this should continue to spread northward
along the I-35 corridor through morning. Area VAD wind profiles
indicate a 30-40 kt southerly wind between 925-850 mb. This
stronger low level jet is in response to a deepening low over the
central Plains ahead of the disturbance over the Southwest. While
the GOES precipitable water product does show drier air over North
Texas, there is a pool of better moisture along the coast. This
moisture rich air will spread north through the day. So, we`ll
likely have to deal with some morning low clouds along the I-35
corridor and areas east.

The surge of low level moisture will be accompanied by weak low
level warm advection and we could see some scattered showers
spread into our far southeastern counties this afternoon.
Otherwise, most areas will remain hot and dry. Highs today will
top out in the mid 90s. Any ongoing showers this afternoon will
diminish this evening and partly cloudy skies will prevail with
lows falling into the mid 70s.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 345 AM CDT Fri Sep 27 2019/
/Saturday and beyond/

The last weekend of September and first week of October will
continue to feature temperatures well above seasonal normals.
There are a few chances for showers/storms over the next few
days, but these chances remain low (30% or less) and most won`t
see much measurable rainfall.

The cut-off low will be embedded with the main upper level flow by
Saturday and provide low chances for rain/storms as it translates
northeastward. The increase in southerly winds will help moisture
stream across the region, aiding in some isolated to scattered
storms on Saturday. However, the best forcing for ascent may
remain displaced from our region, and PoPs will be limited to
20-30% across North and Central Texas. The upper level ridge
across the Southeast will continue to build and limit rain chances
for the eastern half of the region through the latter half of the
weekend and into the work week. With our region located along the
western periphery of the ridge, the only areas with a low chance
for showers/storms will remain across parts of Central Texas each
afternoon through the first half of the work week. I expect mostly
isolated to scattered coverage of showers/storms associated with
the seabreeze as there won`t be much forcing for ascent due to the
effects of the ridge. Otherwise, most of North and Central Texas
will begin the month of October with rain-free conditions and
above-normal temperatures.

Unfortunately, the slight glimmer of hope of relief from the heat
by the Thursday/Friday continues to fade. Most of the latest model
guidance continues to trend on the warmer end of the spectrum,
with afternoon high temperatures on Thursday in the low to mid
90s. The latest GFS attempts to push the cold front through the
region on Thursday allowing temperatures to cool and bring us
much needed rainfall. However, the ECMWF and ensembles trend
toward a warmer and drier solution with the cold front remaining
northwest of the region and only limited rain chances across the
northwest as riding remains in place.
