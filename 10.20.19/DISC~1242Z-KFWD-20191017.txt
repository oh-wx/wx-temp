.AVIATION...
/12z TAFs/

Concerns and challenges: None...VFR with BKN-OVC300 through 21z-
00z, becoming SKC tonight. Calm winds this morning becoming SE 5
knots or less by 18z and after.

Dry NE low level flow slowly veers SE by this afternoon. A cut
off upper low over W TX will continue to produce plentiful cirrostratus
over the region the majority of the day. As this system shifts
E across S TX through the day and the surface high shifts E toward
the MS/TN/OH valleys, skies will clear with winds coming around to
a light SE. No precipitation is expected the next 24-30 hours.

.SHORT TERM... /Issued 300 AM CDT Thu Oct 17 2019/
/Today and Tonight/

A broad surface high pressure ridge was extended southwest across
the area this morning from the Mid Mississippi Valley. This has
resulted in near calm winds with a very cool start to your Thursday.
Many areas will start off in the 40s, except your typical heat
island areas that will likely remain in the lower 50s. If not for
plentiful cirrostratus draped overhead in advance of a closed mid
level low over the Trans Pecos region mitigating radiational
cooling to an extent, it`s likely not as chilly as it could`ve
been. The mid level low will slowly migrate east today across
South Texas, as it is forced eastward in response to deep mid
level energy digging southeast from British Columbia into the
Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies today.

About the only effect from our closed low will be an gradual
eastward progression of the high cloud canopy overhead with a very
dry airmass noted below 600mb. There may be a little mid level
moisture near our far southern Central Texas counties that some
virga may be observed through the day. Otherwise, the surface high
will shift east away from our area as well with light south-
southeast winds returning across much of the area by this evening.
Despite this, the high cloud canopy will be slow to clear especially
across our southern and eastern counties. This should be enough
to keep highs down in the lower 70s there...while highs this
afternoon push 80 degrees across the far northwest counties where
more clearing and insolation will be realized sooner.

Skies will clear in wake of our departing mid level low exiting
east toward the Central Gulf Coastal area tonight. South winds
will increase in response to rapid pressure falls along the lee of
the Rockies in advance of the aforementioned Western CONUS mid
level trough organizing over the Western CONUS. Despite the
increasing south winds, the dry airmass in place and better set up
for radiational cooling will likely result in yet one more cool
morning Friday with temperatures starting out the day between lows
45 to 55 degrees.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 300 AM CDT Thu Oct 17 2019/
/Friday through Thursday/
Southerly flow and generally sunny skies will prevail over the
region on Friday allowing temperatures to warm into the mid 80s
in the western zones to the mid 70s in the east. This will send
relative humidity down to near 30 percent and could result in a
heightened grass fire risk on Friday afternoon over the western
zones where fuels are the driest. As an upper level trough moves
through the Southern Plains Friday night, it drags a weak cold
front through our area Saturday morning. Ahead of the front higher
moisture will stream northward resulting in some above normal
overnight lows in the 60s, but drier air will quickly return to
the region behind the front. As a result, a pleasant, but mild
Saturday is forecast with highs in the 80s and lots of sunshine.
While a few early morning showers can`t be ruled out across the
Red River counties with the front, it is more likely that this
activity will stay in Oklahoma where better large scale forcing
occurs.

The weak Saturday front will reach the Texas coast by Sunday
morning and then retreat northward during the day as a much
stronger upper level trough begins to deepen across the central
part of the country. Surface pressure falls will result in
increasing southerly winds of 10 to 20 mph by afternoon. While
large scale forcing for ascent will begin to overspread the region
Sunday afternoon, the return of moisture and instability will lag
behind due to the impacts of the Saturday front. This means fire
weather conditions may approach critical levels across the western
zones where highs should exceed 90. The remainder of the region
should see highs in the 80s but have slightly higher RH. The
prospects for rain will likely hold off until after sunset Sunday
for most of the region when moisture finally increases and
results in enough instability for primarily elevated convection.

The chances of showers and storms will be best across the eastern
areas where rain will be likely, but PoPs taper down to just a
low chance in the western zones where moisture will not have as
much time to return ahead of the cold front. A low severe weather
risk appears to be present, mainly east of I-35, but surface
based convection looks unlikely. A strongly sheared airmass and
modest amounts of elevated instability do suggest a low-end hail
threat. Convection associated with the trough and front will be
most likely around and after midnight Sunday night, clearing from
northwest to southeast Monday morning. Rain amounts should
average a tenth of an inch in the west to 1 inch in the east.

Slightly cooler conditions will return Monday with breezy
northwesterly winds and highs in the 70s as skies clear during the
day. Good radiational cooling will result in cool low temps on
Monday night in the 40s. Generally pleasant and seasonable
weather will prevail Tuesday into Wednesday with gradually
moderating temperatures in dry northwest flow aloft. By Thursday
the next trough will begin to deepen again across the Plains which
should bring southerly winds back and increasing moisture ahead
of the next front and chance of rain Friday morning.
