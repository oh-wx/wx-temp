Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Fort Worth TX
629 AM CDT Wed Oct 16 2019


.AVIATION...
VFR will prevail through the period with just some high clouds
streaming across the area from the southwest. The clouds near 050
around Waco will linger a few more hours before clearing as the
frontal layer deepens and shunts all low level moisture to the
south. Otherwise, north winds will be near 15-20kt this morning,
but will subside to 10-15kt by this afternoon. The north winds
will diminish to near 5kt tonight as high pressure settles into
the region.

.SHORT TERM... /Issued 359 AM CDT Wed Oct 16 2019/
/Today and Tonight/
The cold front has pushed through the area and northerly winds at
10 to 20 mph with higher gusts are transporting cooler air into
the region. Cold advection will continue through the morning hours
but begin to wane this afternoon as winds diminish to near 10 mph
and abundant sunshine across the Southern Plains modifies the
temperature gradient. While most of North Texas will see sunny
skies today, high clouds will persist across Central Texas due to
an upper level low that will slowly move through West Texas today.
Some of this mid and high cloud cover will spill back to the
north later tonight as the low edges eastward, which will have
implications on overnight low temperatures. For today most of the
region will reach the upper 60s and low 70s, but tonight lows will
range from the lower 40s in the north where winds should become
nearly calm with clear skies, to the lower 50s across the southern
zones where the impacts of mid and upper level cloud cover will
keep temps a several degrees warmer.

/FIRE WEATHER/
Grass fires may be a concern this afternoon as relative humidity
drops below 25% west of I-35 while winds continue at 10 mph. Some
recent light rainfall has likely helped increase the moisture
content of fine fuels, but the mild and dry conditions today will
likely result in rapid drying during the day. Believe that weather
and fuel conditions are still too marginal to warrant any fire
weather products for today, but grass fires may become of more
concern later this week and weekend across the western zones.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 359 AM CDT Wed Oct 16 2019/
/Thursday through Tuesday/

As is characteristic for mid-October, the large-scale upper-
level pattern over the Southern Plains will remain progressive
from Thursday onward through the middle of next week. Following
today`s cool-off, North and Central Texas will experience
predominately dry conditions through Sunday with a steady day to
day increase in temperatures. A strong front will push through the
area Sunday night, bringing a chance of showers/storms to most of
the forecast area, followed by clearing and a return to
seasonable conditions through the early part of next week.

The post-frontal surface ridge dominating North Texas today will
shift east of the region Thursday, with nascent lee-side
troughing facilitating a light southerly return flow by afternoon.
A shortwave trough will move into the Central and Southern
Rockies by Friday, deepening the surface trough over West
Texas/New Mexico and invigorating the southerly winds over our
area. Afternoon temperatures west of I-35 should rebound into the
80s by Friday afternoon, while upper 70s linger in the east. The
combination of minimum relative humidities in the 25-30% range and
gusty south winds will lead to some elevated fire weather
conditions across our far western counties Friday afternoon,
though Red Flag criteria probably won`t be reached.

The Rockies shortwave will eject across the Plains and Midwest on
Saturday, and deamplify. This trough will help push a weak cold
front southward into North Texas by midday Saturday. Lift and
moisture are not impressive with this system, but did keep a small
PoP in our far northeast Red River counties for the possibility
of pre-dawn showers Saturday morning. The Euro is a bit more
progressive than the GFS is in pushing this boundary south and
eastward into Central and Eastern Texas by Saturday evening. Both
solutions suggest the front will hang up along the southern
eastern margins of our CWA, and wash out Saturday night as the
upper level flow backs ahead of the next upstream system.

Sunday sets up as the warmest day of the forecast period, as
strong southerly winds and low level warm advection become
well established regionwide. Under mostly sunny skies, readings
will climb above 90 in most areas by afternoon, with upper 80s -
and humid conditions - occurring in the east.

By Sunday evening, a sharp upper level trough will depart the
Rockies and begin to enter the Plains States. A Canadian cold
front will penetrate our northwest counties after midnight, and
clear our entire CWA by mid morning Monday. Both the GFS and Euro
advertise a band of showers and thunderstorms developing
along/ahead of this front, with the best potential existing closer
to the Red River where large-scale forcing for ascent will be
greatest. Went with chance PoPs across all of the area, highest
in the northeast after midnight. CAPE and 0-6km shear values
suggest a potential for isolated strong/severe storms late Sunday
night/Monday morning, and this will need to be monitored as we
move forward.

Beautiful dry fall weather will dominate North and Central Texas
Monday and Tuesday, with cool mornings and seasonable afternoon
temperatures both days.
