Area Forecast Discussion...UPDATED

.AVIATION...
/12 UTC TAF Cycle/

Concerns---Ceiling and visibility trends.

A large blanket of IFR cigs persist this morning mainly at D10
terminals. IFR cigs will continue through the day as modest lift
coupled with low level saturation will remain in place. IFR vsby
at D/FW...DAL and GKY can be expected as a slightly greater band
of ascent continues to rotate northeastward. By mid-morning, MVFR
to VFR vsby is likely. Toward the afternoon, MVFR cigs will be
possible as solar insolation attempts to work on the low level
moisture field. Confidence in the timing to the return to MVFR is
low and it is quite possible that cigs remain below 1KFT. Breezy
west to northwest winds may induce a crosswind component for
north-south oriented runways. These crosswinds....when coupled
with IFR conditions, will result in impacts to the North Texas
airspace. MVFR is expected through the entire TAF cycle at
Waco...though cigs may fall into the IFR category at times this
morning.

I`ll show an optimistic trend for the latter half of the TAF with
MVFR this afternoon and through the evening hours. As mentioned
above, however, these trends may be too optimistic. Regardless,
intermittent IFR may re-develop after 06 UTC Saturday and I`ve
included a TEMPO group at most airfields across North Texas as the
low levels cool and re-saturate to reflect this.

.SHORT TERM... /Issued 334 AM CDT Fri Oct 25 2019/
/Today and Tonight/

Dreary conditions are anticipated over the next 24 hours
across most of North and Central Texas. Along with chances for
rain and patchy drizzle, will be unseasonably cool conditions.

Surface analysis as of 3 AM indicated that the stout front that
moved through the area on Thursday continues to plow southward
through the Texas coastline. Warm air advection atop the cooler
airmass will continue to promote the rainy conditions. With
instability values slowly dwindling, there shouldn`t be much in
the way of vigorous convection, though an isolated storm or two
cannot be ruled out...especially under the cooler upper low. The
lack of thunderstorm activity should hinder widespread flood
concerns, though rises on small streams and creeks are possible.

For this afternoon, the most likely area for a slightly greater
concentration of rain and thunderstorms will be across East Texas
and along the Red River as a TROWAL (trough of warm air aloft)
becomes established as the main upper low slowly jogs eastward.
I`ve nudged PoPs up some from the previous forecast mainly near
and north of I-20 for this afternoon and into the early evening
hours. Otherwise, most areas will remain socked in with clouds and
pockets of drizzle through the afternoon. High temperatures
across the western Red River Valley into northern parts of the Big
Country will be the recipients of stronger CAA and highs may
struggle to get out of the 40s. Across East Texas, however, the
TROWAL may allow temperatures to approach 60 degrees. At D/FW and
Waco, we`ll likely be flirting with record low maximum
temperatures for this date (52 and 56 both in 1957 respectively).
If clearing occurs more readily (or the TROWAL extends farther
west) than forecast, however, temperatures will likely shoot up
into the upper 50s/low 60s. This appears unlikely at this time.

Rain chances will slowly taper off tonight as the upper low (and
thus the TROWAL) slowly depart the region. While chilly conditions
are anticipated, the cloud cover will actually keep temperatures
from plummeting. Overnight lows will still fall below normal
values with most sites falling into the upper 30s and 40s.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 334 AM CDT Fri Oct 25 2019/
/Saturday through Next Week/

The upper low near the Arklatex at the beginning of the period
will accelerate off to the northeast as a larger scale trough
begins to deepen over the western CONUS. Temperatures will rebound
Saturday as skies clear from west to east, with afternoon highs
climbing well into the 60s. The deepening trough will induce lee-
Rockies cyclogenesis, causing north winds to shift to the south
Saturday night. Warm advection will not really get going, however,
until Sunday, so a chilly Saturday night is still on tap with
lows in the 40s. Increasing southerly low level flow coupled with
mostly sunny skies will allow temperatures to climb into the 70s
area-wide on Sunday.

The positioning of the western trough will actually draw cool
Canadian air down the eastern flank of the Rockies. With deep
troughing staying put across the western third of the nation, a
lead shortwave will race eastward across the Rockies and into the
Plains on Monday, essentially pushing the the leading edge of the
cold air southward through the region Monday night. The high
temperature forecast for Monday gets a little tricky and will
depend on how quickly the front arrives. For now we will keep
highs in the 60s across the northwest and 70s elsewhere, and
adjust as confidence in timing increases.

Scattered showers and a few storms will accompany the front Monday
night, and at first glance all convective parameters imply that
severe weather is unlikely. Similar to the ongoing upper level
storm system, the GFS is really progressive with next week`s
system, sweeping it through the Plains and bringing an abrupt end
to precipitation early Wednesday (as are the majority of its
ensemble members). The current forecast will follow closer to
ECMWF and Canadian model guidance which indicate a slower and
partially cut-off system traversing the Plains around mid-week.
This would keep a cold and wet pattern in place through mid-week
as strong isentropic ascent persists Tuesday night and possibly
into Wednesday. Precipitation should then end from west to east
Wednesday evening as the upper low heads for the Great Lakes.

Below-normal temperatures are likely to begin Monday night or
Tuesday behind the front. The coldest conditions will likely occur
Wednesday night as the upper low exits to the east and skies
clear from the west. Just about all of the forecast area should
see lows bottom out in the 30s, and locations west of I-35 and
north of I-20 have a good chance of dropping below freezing by
daybreak Thursday. Temperatures should remain below normal through
Friday and then return to near normal readings with dry weather
appear likely as we enter next weekend.
