.AVIATION...
/12Z TAFs/

Concerns or challenges: None. VFR with occasional streaks of high
clouds(cirrus) through tonight within NW flow aloft overhead.

Surface high pressure across the area and regional airports will
shift southward today, leading to SW winds 5-7 knots this morning.
As lee side pressure falls increase over the Southern High Plains
and Rockies, winds will back around to the S around 10 knots by
21z today...continuing tonight.

.SHORT TERM... /Issued 326 AM CST Sun Nov 24 2019/
/Today and Tonight/

Quiet weather continues for the rest of your weekend, dry
northwest flow aloft persists with a warmer day ahead for your
Sunday. Broad surface high pressure continues to sink southward
into South Texas and the western Gulf of Mexico today. After a
chilly start to the day in the 30s and lower 40s with some patchy
frost around, west-southwesterly flow early in the day will
eventually back southerly by this evening. This flow combined with
plentiful sunshine will allow for some modest compressional
warming and highs reaching well into the 60s east to the lower to
possibly mid 70s west. A few high clouds will increase with a mid
level impulse arriving late today and this evening. Otherwise,
look for southerly winds near 10 mph tonight under mostly clear
conditions. The modest southerly wind will combine with slightly
higher surface dew points temperatures for slightly warmer start
to your day on Monday. Lows will remain up in the 40s with evening
readings remaining around 50 degrees across Central Texas and
immediate urban areas of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 326 AM CST Sun Nov 24 2019/
/Monday Onward/

A common phrase that is used in the transition months, especially
across Texas is If you dont like the weather, then wait a
minute. In this case, just wait until the next day. Monday and
Tuesday will remain warm and dry for most, then a cold front will
barge in on Wednesday. An elevated fire weather threat will exist
west of I-35 Tuesday. Rain chances increase Wednesday and will
linger through Saturday night.

Monday and Tuesday will be characterized by above normal
temperatures as weak upper level ridging takes hold of North and
Central Texas. A low level cyclone is likely to develop across the
Red River Monday into Tuesday, and as it does so, it will help
turn our winds southwesterly. In addition, winds above the surface
will likely be racing to the northeast at 50-60 mph. Although
those high winds are not expected at the surface, the
unidirectional low-level wind profile along with fairly dry
atmosphere will enhance downward momentum transfer Tuesday
afternoon. Sustained surface winds Tuesday afternoon are expected
to range from around 15 mph in the east to upwards of 25 mph in
the west. In addition, gusts in excess of 35 mph would not be
surprising, especially west of I-35. With the surface low across
Oklahoma, a dryline is expected to develop generally west of a
Bowie to Mineral Wells to Lampasas line. Areas west of this line
will likely experience elevated fire weather conditions.

A cold front will advance into the region late Tuesday night into
Wednesday, shifting area winds from southwesterly to
northwesterly. The front, given the lack of low level convergence
and moisture, is expected to remain dry for much of North Texas.
With winds along the coast expected to be more southerly, better
moisture will exist across the eastern portions of Central Texas.
Although surface convergence will not be significant, increasing
moisture and weak instability may lead to a storm or two in the
southeast.

Isentropic descent immediately following the cold front will
quickly shift around and become ascent as the next shortwave
approaches the region from the southwest. Rainfall is likely to
begin southwest of our region, then spread across much of the area
Wednesday into the first half of the day on Thursday. The lack of
instability as this shortwave moves across will likely lead to
mainly rain showers through the overnight period. The shortwave
will then continue on its northeast track, likely decreasing rain
intensity and coverage Thanksgiving afternoon and evening. High
temperatures both Wednesday and Thursday will remain below normal,
with upper 40s along the Red River to lower 60s in Central Texas.

A high amplitude mid level trough will be building into the
western United States on Wednesday and Thursday, then move
eastward as we commence the Thanksgiving weekend. A strong
shortwave will eject east/northeastward, with the main forcing for
ascent expected to remain well north of our region. However, a
Pacific front will likely swing across the area on Friday and will
likely enhance the potential for precipitation once again. Given
the approaching trough, dynamic cooling aloft will provide
increasing lapse rates, therefore, isolated to scattered
thunderstorms cant be ruled out Friday into Saturday.

Much drier air will be moving in Saturday afternoon, likely
ending our precipitation chances from northwest to southeast.
Temperatures next weekend are expected to be near to below normal,
with dry conditions for the entire region by Sunday.
