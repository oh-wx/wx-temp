.AVIATION...
/12Z TAFs/

Concerns...
(1) low-level wind shear this morning
(2) virga with sub-cloud turbulence
(3) multiple wind shifts
(4) crosswind potential this evening

A strong (but dry) low-level jet has introduced some low-level
wind shear this morning. The sharp boundary at the base of the jet
will gradually erode later this morning as this momentum is mixed
over a greater depth. This will also bring the stronger winds to
the surface, the gusts prevailing through the afternoon. Although
a dryline will approach, it will likely remain west of our TAF
sites. The surface flow will veer, but a wind shift to the west is
not anticipated until this evening. A brief window of minor
crosswind issues will occur between the dryline`s passage and the
eventual cold front that will shift the winds to the northwest.

Virga will accompany a passing disturbance aloft this morning.
The descending mid deck is evidence of this lift, but the dry
sub-cloud layer should prevent sprinkles from reaching the
surface. However, the evaporation of these hydrometeors will
result in turbulence, primarily FL070-120.

.SHORT TERM... /Issued 433 AM CST Tue Nov 26 2019/
/Today and Tonight/

An upper low will steadily deepen as it emerges from the Rockies
today. Its approach has already drawn a tropical plume of high
clouds across the Lone Star State, but the layer within 3-4 miles
of the surface remains very dry. VWP data from KFWS suggests the
associated low-level jet has reached 50kts within 4000 ft of the
surface, but this strongly veered flow is resulting in negligible
moist advection. The exception is through portions of Central and
East Texas where Monday`s dryline intrusion failed to scour the
boundary layer moisture. A lead impulse will swing through the
region this morning, which may result in some rain drops from a
gradually descending mid deck, but the majority of this
precipitation should evaporate long before reaching the ground
(despite what radar echoes might suggest to the untrained eye).
Even where the low-level moisture may appear more favorable, the
rain drops will still have a considerable depth of dry air to
transit. But since such lift can occasionally produce
precipitation of adequate intensity to overcome the dry descent,
we`ll maintain a mention of sprinkles in many areas through mid-
morning.

Although the main upper low will track through the Central Plains
well to our north, the right entrance region of its downstream
150-kt jet streak will swipe North Texas through the afternoon
hours. This will enhance the 700-mb flow, the marked westerly
component of which will encourage a renewed dryline surge today.
Despite the tightening moisture discontinuity, this forcing will
be separated from the forcing aloft, and our tepid daytime PoPs
are primarily focused on less organized convection that may
materialize deeper into the warm sector. However, the dryline will
pose some hazards to our northwestern zones, which will see a
sharp uptick in wind speeds with gusts approaching 40 mph. In
addition to the previously issued wind advisory that addresses
this, there will also be elevated fire weather concerns in the
post-dryline air as these winds combine with relative humidity
values below 25 percent. Cured, dormant vegetation will be
susceptible to fire initiation, and the winds will promote the
spread of any grass fires that occur.

A Pacific cold front will eventually overwhelm the dryline
tonight, surging through Central and East Texas during the early
morning hours. Although a few showers or storms may accompany the
boundary as it penetrates the richer moisture, these should be
short-lived, quickly racing northeast out of the CWA. Cold air
will then pour into the region, with temperatures falling into the
30s in our northern and western zones by daybreak Wednesday
morning. But with the parent cyclone lifting into the Great Lakes
states, the momentum behind the frontal boundary will gradually
subside, mitigating the intensity of the wind chill.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 433 AM CST Tue Nov 26 2019/
/Wednesday Through the Holiday Weekend/

As our first system lifts quickly northeast away from the area and
toward the Great Lakes Wednesday morning, shortwave ridging will
briefly set up for a dry start to the day Wednesday and even some
partial sunshine. A surface cold front will be exiting off the
Texas Coast with a north wind 10 to 15 mph and highs only rising
into the 50s most areas. By afternoon and evening, mid to high
clouds will thicken as a strong mid level impulse lifts northeast
from Mexico toward the area. Isentropic ascent will begin increasing
over the top of the frontal inversion in place across the area for
increasing chances for a light rain across northern and western
parts of the area late in the day and into Wednesday evening.
The entire area becomes encompassed by occasional shower activity
by the Thanksgiving morning with steep enough lapse rates south of
I-20 for an occasional clap of thunder. With an environmental
pocket of dry air to initially overcome below 750mb, rainfall will
be light initially. The damp and cool conditions will continue
throughout Thanksgiving Day, so if you`re traveling to see family
or friends, driving conditions will be on the sloppy side with
high temperatures ranging from the 40s northwest to the lower 60s
across eastern Central Texas.

The mid level flow begins amplifying readily Thanksgiving night,
as the next vigorous mid level system organizing out west drops
down the Oregon and California Coastlines. This will result in
shortwave ridging aloft by Thanksgiving evening briefly across
those areas east of I-35, which will lessen rain chances. The
reprieve doesn`t last long, however, as yet another mid level
impulse arrives from Mexico overnight and draws the old frontal
boundary rapidly northward across the area during the overnight
and early morning hours on Friday. Forcing and ascent related to
these features will result in on and off showers with a few
embedded and mainly elevated thunderstorms through the morning
hours; as initial surface temperatures will remain on the cool
side. By afternoon Friday, the entire area will be within a broad
warm sector in advance of our approaching mid level low
approaching from the west. Morning convection will likely corrupt
the environment with extensive cloud cover and shower activity.
Despite the clouds and showers, a warm up into the 70s will
ensue by Friday afternoon, but not to the extent of model blends
are advertising extensive cloud cover should limit diurnal heating
to an extent.

Surface dew points will be well into the 60s when even a few
readings near 70 degrees across Central Texas late on Friday; an
indicator of the moisture-rich airmass that will be in place.
With insolation lacking for extensive heating and destabilization,
an axis of modest instability of 1000-1500 J/KG will develop in
advance of a surface trough approaching from the west late Friday
afternoon and continuing into the evening. Lapse rates aloft will
be steepening as large-scale ascent increases with the arrival of
the deep deep longwave trough to our west. Deep layer shear and
0-1km shear will be impressive, so kinematics are not in question
for at least a threat for a few strong to severe storms during
this period. As for severe weather modes, there will be a
localized threat for damaging winds and marginally severe hail,
along with a localized heavy rainfall threat with a moisture-rich
airmass in place. This far out, it`s very difficult to know how
the thermodynamic environment materializes with all the convective
interruption expected during the morning hours friday. If morning
activity isn`t as widespread, then we could see a more enhanced
severe weather window later Friday afternoon and Friday night. We
shall know more as this system becomes better samples by the
upper-air network. In addition, localized rain amounts along and
north of I-20 and east of US 281 to between 1 to 3 inches are
expected from Thanksgiving through Saturday morning -- with higher
isolated amounts possible. I would expect run off and minor flooding
will be possible as we move into the early part of the holiday
weekend. I do not believe there will be a flash flood threat,
though I couldn`t rule out an isolated instance by later Friday
into Saturday morning.

A cold front will will overtake the pre-frontal trough Friday
night, with a broken line of storms moving east and southeast with
the cold front as it moves areas east of I-35 through early Saturday
morning. By Saturday afternoon, the storm threat will have ended
as our unseasonably moisture airmass is replaced by a much drier
and mP/cP airmass. Despite wet ground, downsloping from breezy
west winds and plentiful sunshine Saturday afternoon will allow
high temperatures to warm readily into the 70s most areas. The
warm up doesn`t last long, however, as a colder airmass entrains
in for the end of the holiday weekend. The resultant cold
advection and dry air arriving into the region will help cool lows
down into the 30s and 40s Sunday morning, with highs only
rebounding into the 50s despite plentiful sunshine expected
throughout the day. Next Monday morning will be our coldest as
surface high pressure moves in with winds becoming light under
clear skies. Lows should fall into the upper 20s and 30 areawide.
Otherwise, highs will recover back into the 50s with a warming
trend expected as we move through next week.
