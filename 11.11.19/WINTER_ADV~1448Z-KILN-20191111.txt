...Slick Spots Expected Tonight and Tomorrow Morning...

.A strong cold front will push through the region this afternoon
ushering in much colder temperatures by this evening. Ongoing rain
will change over to snow this evening from north to south with
southern Indiana seeing the changeover by sunset and then much of
northern Kentucky seeing the changeover this evening.

While temperatures will sharply fall this evening, the warm ground
temperatures will lag behind by several hours. The snow this
evening may fall heavy enough at times to cover road surfaces
temporarily. However, much of the accumulation will mainly be
found on elevated and grassy surfaces. As the precipitation ends
after midnight, residual moisture on the roadways may refreeze.
Overpasses and bridges will be the first to see impacts since they
have much more exposure to the cold air. The refreezing on the
roadways may be offset due to strong northwesterly winds that will
be seen behind the front. Northwest winds of 10-15 MPH with gusts
to 25-30 MPH will be possible and will help dry off the roads.
However, in areas that are sheltered from the wind, icy spots may
be found late tonight and Tuesday morning.

...Accumulating Snow and Sharply Falling Temperatures for Much of
Eastern Kentucky Tonight into Tuesday Morning...

.Behind a cold front arriving this evening, a strong surge of
arctic air will make its way into eastern Kentucky. Temperatures
are expected to rapidly fall below freezing tonight, with any
ongoing rain showers forecast to change over to snow showers from
west to east through the night and continue into early Tuesday
morning. This will result in the first measurable snowfall of the
season, along with easily the coldest temperatures we have seen so
far this fall. Most locations are expected to receive around an
inch of snow accumulation, mainly on elevated or grassy surfaces
- though some ridges could pick up near two inches. For locations
above 2000 feet up to three inches of snow will be possible by
sunrise Tuesday. The snow will end as flurries from west to east
Tuesday morning.

In addition to snowfall, such a sharp temperature drop may cause
wet roads to freeze in spots, leading to a potential for slick
and icy road conditions late tonight into Tuesday morning. Please
exercise caution during the Tuesday morning commute and allow
ample time to reach your destination.
