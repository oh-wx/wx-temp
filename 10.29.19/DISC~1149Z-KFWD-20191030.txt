Area Forecast Discussion...UPDATED
National Weather Service Fort Worth TX

.AVIATION...
/12Z TAFs/

Concerns: IFR ceilings, widespread showers, and isolated
thunderstorms continuing across North and Central Texas this
morning. Storms and precip should end by the early afternoon, then
expect improving flight conditions with VFR prevailing by the
early evening. Gusty north winds are expected this afternoon and
overnight.

The area remains under the influence of a stalled out frontal
boundary with widespread IFR ceilings, rain showers, and isolated
thunderstorms affecting all of D10 and North/Central Texas. In
regard to thunderstorms, a cluster of storms is currently moving
NE out of D10 airspace, with a 1-2 hour lull in thunderstorm
activity expected. Storms will move back into the airspace from
the SE around 13-14Z and last for 2-4 hours affecting all terminals
and arrival gates. The storms should remain northeast of KACT until
around 14-16Z, with a few hours of storms in the vicinity of Waco
expected this morning. The current TAF does not include prevailing
thunder in any TAF, but it may be warranted before the 18Z TAF
package is created.

A strong cold front will move through North and Central Texas this
afternoon, around 18-20Z, bringing in gusty winds out of the
north. The front will also bring an end to the precipitation and
lift the ceilings to MVFR initially based around 1200-2000 ft. A
steadily increasing cloud base is expected to prevail for several
hours after the winds increase in speed...eventually becoming VFR
by the early evening hours. Gusty winds will continue through the
night with clear skies prevailing by around midnight.

.SHORT TERM... /Issued 339 AM CDT Wed Oct 30 2019/
/Today and Tonight/

The leading edge of a cold airmass remains south of the forecast
area this morning with an overrunning pattern persisting. Modest
isentropic ascent overtop of the cold pool has led to the
continuation of widespread rain showers and isolated thunderstorms
across the area. This will be the primary lifting mechanism for
precip through the morning, however, a stronger cold front will
move into the area this afternoon and then become the primary
forcing mechanism for precipitation this afternoon and evening.

A deep upper trough will start to move into the Central Plains
this afternoon which will induce cyclogenesis just north of our
area. A rather strong upper level jet and recent warm/moist
advection in the low levels (just over the surface) will promote
strong frontogenesis associated with the aformentioned low this
morning. These processes will help drive a strong cold front
south into North Texas early this afternoon and Central Texas this
evening.

Widespread showers with isolated embedded thunderstorms should
continue at and ahead of the cold front through the afternoon,
with the highest rainfall amounts expected east of I-35 and south
of I-20. Strong subsidence behind the front will finally bring and
end to the precip beginning in the northeastern zones by around
noon, the Metroplex by the early afternoon, and Central Texas this
evening. The clouds will also start clearing out of the area from
west to east tonight. Very strong cold air advection and a
tightening pressure gradient will strengthen the winds this
afternoon and evening with sustained northerly winds between 20-30
mph and gusts upwards of 40 mph possible. The cold air associated
with the front will keep the cold temperatures in place, in
particular overnight tonight when the first widespread freeze of
the season is expected. As such, we have upgraded the Freeze Watch
to a Freeze Warning for much of the area west of I-35 and north
of I-20 tonight into Thursday morning.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 339 AM CDT Wed Oct 30 2019/
/Thursday through Next Week/

Cold mornings are anticipated on Thursday and Friday with a slight
increase in both daytime highs and overnight lows thereafter. Dry
conditions are expected for most of the outlook period, with the
excepting being Tuesday of next week.

We will end the month of October on a cold note! Thursday morning
will be frigid for most areas with a widespread freeze for North
and parts of Central Texas. The northerly winds should be on the
decline, but wind chills may still fall into the upper teens
across North Texas to twenties elsewhere on Thursday morning.
Despite full solar insolation during the day on Thursday, strong
cold air advection will likely keep temperatures 20 to 25 degrees
below normal values. Highs in the upper 40s to low 50s are
forecast. Thursday night appears rain/storm-free for all of North
and Central Texas with clear skies and light winds as surface
high pressure builds across the region. Evening temperatures will
fall into the 30s and 40s, so bundle up and dress warmly if
headed outdoors for evening festivities. Just prior to sunrise,
the excellent radiational cooling will allow most if not all
locations to fall below 32 degrees across the FA, with even some
locales across the Big Country falling into the mid 20s. I`ve
gone ahead and issued a Freeze Watch (in effect for Friday
morning) for locations to the east and southeast of the current
Freeze Warning (that is in effect for Thursday morning).

With return flow establishing itself on Friday ahead of the next
cold front, we should see temperatures increase by 10 to 15
degrees compared to Thursday across the area. While highs in the
upper 50s to mid 60s are forecast, these values are still 10 to 15
degrees below normal. It is possible that temperatures may need
to be increased some, depending on the degree of veering ahead of
the next frontal boundary slated to move southward through the
area late Friday into early Saturday. Despite FROPA, Friday into
Saturday appears rain/storm free as moisture advection within the
southerly flow regime will be practically non-existent thanks to
previous frontal intrusions into the Gulf of Mexico.

Saturday night into Sunday will be chilly, though post-frontal
winds will be sufficient to keep temperatures a few degrees
greater than the previous night. We will warm nicely late Sunday
and into next week as stronger southerly flow develops in response
to zonal flow across the Central Plains. High temperatures through
early next week will be within a few degrees of climatological
norms. A frontal boundary will head southward on Tuesday as a
shortwave trough ripples through the zonal flow to the north of
the Lone Star State. Low level moisture return ahead of Tuesday`s
front may be sufficient for rain and a few storms. With this in
mind, I`ve inserted low PoPs, mainly across Central and East Texas
on Tuesday afternoon.
