.AVIATION...
/12Z TAFs/

Concerns and Challenges: None. VFR/SKC through tonight, then FEW-
SCT300 after 12z Wednesday within NW flow regime aloft.

Main challenge today will be transition of surface high from the
Big Country toward Central/SE TX/TX Coast through 00z Wednesday.
NW winds less than 10 knots, may go briefly VRB by 18z today,
before becoming SSW by 21z. S winds increase to around 10 knots by
18z Wednesday, as surface high continues moving away from the area
and lee side pressure falls increase well upstream of North and
Central TX.

.SHORT TERM... /Issued 330 AM CST Tue Jan 7 2020/
/Today Through Tonight/

Today will start off on the chilly side, as strong mid level
impulse continues to pull east away from the area with subsidence
resulting in sunny skies in it`s wake. Surface high pressure
continued to settle across the Big Country and just west of the
CWA early this morning. This feature will expand southeast across
the state and toward the Texas/Louisiana coasts through the day
and help maintain a dry continental airmass across the area. Light
west-northwest winds 5-10 mph this morning will become more
variable this afternoon as the surface high builds across the
area. The dry airmass in place should help temperatures warm
readily under mostly sunny skies, though another mid level wave
arriving later this morning may produce a few streaks of cirrus by
this afternoon. High temperatures are expected to warm into the
60s and likely be a few degrees warmer than Monday. I did go
slightly above blends and toward warmer guidance on high
temperatures this afternoon despite the the lack of any notable
low level warm advection today considering the aforementioned dry
airmass.

Light south winds return tonight under continued mostly clear
skies. Couldn`t rule of a few spurts of cirrus in the northwest
flow overhead, but nothing of significance that will inhibit
strong radiational cooling once again. Outside of the immediate
heat island effect within the immediate DFW Metroplex, the
remainder of North and Central Texas should tank easily into the
lower-mid 30s by sunrise Wednesday. Despite the return of weak
low level southerly flow, it appears right now the airmass near
the surface will be too dry for any fog development late tonight
and early Wednesday.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 330 AM CST Tue Jan 7 2020/
/Wednesday Onward/

An active weather pattern will begin taking shape Wednesday night
and continue into the weekend. Rain chances will gradually
increase starting late Wednesday night mainly east of I-35. Those
rain chances will linger through the day on Thursday. A cold front
will approach the region on Friday , leading to an increasing
potential for strong to severe thunderstorms, once again, mainly
east of I-35. Cooler temperatures are expected on Saturday as the
weather system departs the region. Cant rule out a few snow
flakes flying around Saturday morning along the Red River Valley,
but no impacts are expected.

Wednesday and Thursday...
Sensible weather changes will begin to take place on Wednesday as
an upper level ridge moves off to the east and lee-side cyclogenesis
commences across the central Plains. The deepening low north of
our area will lead to a strong poleward mass response with winds
just above the surface racing northward at 50-60 mph. This will
help draw moisture northward as dewpoints in the 20s on Wednesday
climb into the 60s a day later. The increasing moisture will
likely lead to the development of rain showers late Wednesday
night and continue through much of the day on Thursday. A weak
shortwave will be making its way across the region, providing
increased lift and instability . Cant rule out a couple of
storms embedded within any ongoing precipitation in the afternoon,
but severe weather appears unlikely.

Highs on Wednesday will be around seasonal normals, with lower to
mid 60s throughout the region. As the southerly winds pick up,
highs on Thursday are expected to be in the lower to mid 70s.
Thursday night temperatures will be fairly warm for this time of
the year given the ample amount of moisture preventing
temperatures from decreasing significantly.

Friday and Saturday...

By sunrise Friday, a potent upper level trough will be making its
way into North and Central Texas. Given a moisture rich environment
ahead of the incoming trough, cloud cover is expected to remain
through much of the day on Friday. A cold front will be approaching
from the west, and will likely become the impetus for a line of
thunderstorm that will sweep the region from west to east.

Thermodynamic profiles indicate the presence of a moderate cap
that will be in place during the morning and afternoon hours. As
the upper level trough approaches the region, dynamic cooling will
likely lead to a gradual erosion and lifting of the warm air
aloft. As the cap erodes in the afternoon, instability values will
likely climb to around 1000 to 1500 J/Kg east of I-35. With a
strong low level jet in place, effective bulk shear between 35-40
kts will increase the potential for any updrafts to gain a
supercellular structure. If supercells do develop, all modes of
severe weather would be possible.

The second area that will need to be monitored is the line of
storms that will likely develop along the cold front. Any
remaining warm air aloft will quickly become overcome by strong
ascent associated with the cold front. As the line of storms
progresses eastward, the main hazard will transition to damaging
winds.

Additionally, heavy rain looks likely given PWs are expected to
be between 1.5 to 1.75 ahead of the cold front. With a
generally southwest to northeast storm motion expected, multiple
rounds of heavy rain over the same area could pose a risk of flash
flooding. Rain amounts ranging between 1 to 2.5 will be
possible east of I-35 between Friday and Friday night. The cold
front will quickly push all thunderstorms east of the region late
Friday night. Behind the front, much colder temperatures will
replace the well above normal temperatures we will have
experienced on Friday.

As the main upper level trough traverses across the Southern
Plains on Saturday, wrap around moisture will keep some lingering
rain chances across North Texas through Saturday afternoon.
Although a snowflake or two is possible Saturday along the
counties adjacent to the Red River, the strongest forcing for
ascent and the best moisture will remain well north of our area.
Additionally, temperatures in the lowest couple hundred feet will
remain above freezing, decreasing the potential for wintry
precipitation even further.

Sunday Onward...

With Fridays cold front pushing much of the moisture east of the
region and the main upper level trough departing the the region,
expect Sunday to remain dry across North and Central Texas.
Temperatures are expected to be around seasonal normals, with 50s
and 60s area wide. The next shortwave trough will be moving into
the Central Plains on Monday, leading to a quick return of
southerly winds to the region. Limited moisture will be in place,
but with a reinforcing front moving in on Monday, there could be a
few showers across east Texas the first few days of the upcoming
work week with temperatures expected to be a few degrees above
seasonal normals.
