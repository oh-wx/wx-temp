Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Fort Worth TX
323 PM CST Fri Dec 6 2019


.LONG TERM...
/Sunday Onward/

The main focus of the extended forecast is next Monday night and
Tuesday when fairly widespread rain will overspread the area, with
a low potential for some wintry precip.

The forecast period will begin with warm southerly flow associated
with a broad positively tilted trough encompassing most of the
CONUS. This will lead to a warm and pleasant Sunday with some
gradually increasing cloud cover throughout the day. Highs will
be well above normal, with some readings near 80 west of I-35.

A pair of shortwaves embedded within the aformentioned broad
parent trough will bring some significant changes during the first
half of the week. While Monday will be off to a warm start, a
cold front associated with a lead shortwave will move into North
Texas by the afternoon. An ill-defined dryline feature will get
pulled through the CWA immediately in advance of the front,
scouring the rather meager low-level moisture already in place.
This will keep the actual frontal passage dry as the boundary
sweeps through during the afternoon hours. Fairly strong cold
advection should send temperatures falling into the 50s by the
evening with overnight lows reaching the mid and upper 30s.

The second more vigorous shortwave will dig eastward from
California Monday night into Tuesday morning. Strong synoptic-
scale ascent will occur downstream of this trough in conjunction
with an intensifying upper jet streak. This should aid in the
development of a mid-level frontogenetical band of precipitation
developing to our west and spreading eastward into the CWA Monday
night. The low levels will remain rather dry during this time
period, but light rainfall should eventually be capable of
reaching the ground as top-down saturation occurs. Evaporative
cooling will also aid in cooling the column in conjunction with
post-frontal cold advection. While a cold rain remains the most
likely precipitation type through Tuesday morning, there is at
least a low potential for some snow or sleet pellets to mix with
rain during this time period. Unfortunately, model spreads of low-
level temperature fields deviate highly on Tuesday morning, with
GEFS surface temperature differences of as much as 10-15F. The
low-level thermal profiles will be crucial for this forecast, but
there is much uncertainty still at this time. It`s worth noting
that only about ~20% of GEFS members suggest a potential for a
wintry mix, with the others either remaining too warm or too dry
through the low levels. The good news (barring any drastic
changes) is that surface temperatures are expected to be in the
mid or upper 30s, so even if a changeover to wintry precip could
occur, any accumulation or impacts would be unlikely. Precip is
expected to taper off to the southeast by Tuesday evening.

Upper ridging will build through the middle portion of the week as
we remain between systems. The return of southerly flow will mean
a gradual warming trend, although highs will remain close to
normal in the upper 50s and low 60s. Large-scale subsidence and
drier air will keep the area precip-free Wednesday and Thursday,
but another fast-moving shortwave may allow for rain chances to
return Thursday night and Friday.

.SHORT TERM... /Issued 1232 PM CST Fri Dec 6 2019/
/Today and Tomorrow/

The passage of last night`s cold front has left North and Central
Texas firmly in the grips of a post-frontal airmass today. This
has brought in a brisk north wind, mostly clear skies, and cooler
temperatures to the area. A few patches of wrap around stratus
across East and Central Texas should clear over the next few hours
as both heating from below and isentropic descent from above work
to erode the low level cloud deck. The winds will also begin to
subside as we head into the late afternoon/evening hours as the
surface low continues east and the pressure gradient across the
area weakens.

The post-frontal surface high center will quickly continue east
overnight into the Midwest, with north winds continuing locally as
the surface ridge remains centered to our west. Most of the area
will be under a blanket of upper level clouds tonight, which should
help to regulate radiational cooling. Nonetheless, tonight will
be much cooler than last, with temperatures generally in the upper
30s to low 40s with some areas across our far northwestern
counties dropping at/below freezing.

The quick easterly movement of the surface high will allow the
low level winds aloft to veer to the east by the early morning
hours. This will advect a pool of low level moisture into East
Texas after midnight, spreading into North and Central Texas east
of I-35 by daybreak tomorrow. Once the nocturnal inversion breaks
by mid morning, light southerly/southeasterly winds will prevail
across the area. Temperatures should be slightly cooler than today
largely due to weaker insolation and continued cold air advection
overnight.

.AVIATION... /Issued 1232 PM CST Fri Dec 6 2019/
/18Z TAFs/

Concerns: Gusty north winds early this afternoon. MVFR ceilings
tomorrow morning.

Post-frontal gusty winds up to 20-25 kts will continue through
the early parts of the valid TAF period as high pressure moves
into the area. The wind speeds will gradually weaken through the
afternoon, lessening to AOB 10 kts by 00-02Z. Patchy areas of MVFR
stratus still lingering across Southeast Texas will completely
erode by 21Z allowing VFR to prevail across the region this
afternoon.

An area of MVFR stratus will move into the eastern fringes (from
the east) of D10 by 12-14Z tomorrow morning. The current TAF
includes prevailing MVFR ceilings at DAL/GKY after 15Z, with a
40% chance of at least tempo MVFR ceilings moving into the
remaining D10 terminals and KACT between 15-19Z. By mid morning,
the winds will also become out of the east/southeast with speeds
remaining AOB 10 kts through the day.
